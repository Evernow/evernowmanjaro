# Custom Manjaro ISO for troubleshooting hardware issues

## Goal

This custom build Manjaro ISO aims to be make it easier for a user to be able to determine if an issue is hardware or software based by making it as simple as possible to test it in Manjaro.

## Benefits

Main benefits to this is that a user will not need to interact with the command line to install these tools, nor will they require an internet connection past downloading the ISO (which can be troublesome if a user does not have access to an ethernet connection and has an unsupported wifi card) 

## Drawbacks

1. This ISO is much bigger than the original, size is yet to be detemrined.
2. This ISO is not an easy maintainance task, and adds additional hurdles, due to this all modifications will be minimal, no changes to how Manjaro behaves will be made.


## Modifications

### Added

1. Unigine-Valley
2. Furmark
3. GPU Monitoring tools (GWE for Nvidia, RadeonTop for AMD)
4. Kernel Panic monitoring
5. Prime95
6. Nvidia LTS drivers for the 390 series. 
7. Discord


### Removed
This is removed as an effort to reduce the size of the ISO.

1. VLC
2. qBittorrent
3. Printer drivers


## Reproducability

All pkgbuild files and iso-profiles files will be provided in this repo. 

ISO itself will not be provided here due to bandwidth limitations on this hosted repo, ISO downloads will be provided through Google Drive.
