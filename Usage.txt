## Getting it setup
1. Download the ISO, latest download will always be stored [in this text file, simply copy the text file and put it in your browser](https://github.com/Evernow/evernowmanjaro/blob/main/LatestISO.txt)
2. Download Balena Etcher (scroll down and click download on "Etcher for Windows (x86|x64) (Installer)"): https://www.balena.io/etcher/ 
3. Save both files on a working computer, neither however can be saved in the USB you are about to use to make this.
4. Run etcher, click "Flash from file" then select the Manjaro ISO you downloaded. Then select target as the USB (MAKE SURE IT IS EMPTY, EVERYTHING ON IT WILL BE DELETED OTHERWISE) and finally click flash.
5. Once done flashing, shutdown, go into BIOS / UEFI on the computer you wish to troubleshoot (this has its own wiki: https://www.reddit.com/r/24hoursupport/wiki/enteringbios ) making the USB you flashed the top boot priority, you may also need to disable secure boot before saving and exiting bios.
6. Once booted in you will see a welcome to manjaro screen, using your arrow keys to scroll to driver, if you have an AMD or Intel GPU, select `Open source drivers`. If you have an Nvidia GPU select `Proprietary drivers`.
